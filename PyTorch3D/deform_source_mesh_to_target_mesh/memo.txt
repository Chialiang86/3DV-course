- obj structure
- self-defined chamfer distance

first, we should install the pytorch3d
In this part, we will try to deform a sphere mesh with radious = 1 to target mesh
before deform the mesh, we should normalizing the target mesh
In the optimization step, we will iteratively deform the mesh until the number of iteration to max iteration number
the loss function is defined by the weighted sum of the four losses
- chamfer distance loss
- mesh_edge_loss
- mesh_normal_consistency
- mesh_laplacian_smoothing
here we set the weight as
w_chamfer = 1.0 
# Weight for mesh edge loss
w_edge = 1.0 
# Weight for mesh normal consistency
w_normal = 0.01 
# Weight for mesh laplacian smoothing
w_laplacian = 0.1
